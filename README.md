> :warning: **Note**: This repository is still in an early stage of development. We love the open source community and want to show what we are working on early. We will update this readme with more information once it is safe to use. Until then, feel free to share your thoughts, contact us, and contribute if you'd like.

## Installation

```
npm install @snoopforms/react
```

## How to use it ü§ì

Use the SnoopForm components to build your form easily.

- `SnoopForm:` Use the `SnoopForm` wrapper to make the connection to the SnoopForm Data-Platform.
- `SnoopPage:` Use `SnoopPage` to tell the Form where you need an new page. The SnoopForms library will only show the current page to the user. That way you can build long, more complex forms or a Typeform-like form-view, where the page changes after every question.
- `SnoopElement:` You can choose your `SnoopElement` from a wide range of pre-coded components, including text, email, checkboxes, radio-buttons, and many more.

## Example

```jsx
<SnoopForm domain="app.snoopforms.com" protocol="http" formId="abcd">
  <SnoopPage name="basicInfo">
    <SnoopElement
      type="text"
      name="name"
      label="Your name"
      help="Please use your real name"
      required
    />
    <SnoopElement
      type="textarea"
      name="about"
      label="About you"
      help="e.g. your hobbies etc."
      required
    />
    <SnoopElement name="submit" type="submit" label="Submit" />
  </SnoopPage>
  <SnoopPage name="advancedInfo">
    <SnoopElement
      type="checkbox"
      name="programming-lanuguages"
      label="What programming languages do you love?"
      options={['C++', 'Javascript', 'Scala', 'Assembler']}
    />
    <SnoopElement name="submit" type="submit" label="Submit" />
  </SnoopPage>
  <SnoopPage name="thankyou" thankyou>
    <p>Thanks a lot for your time and insights üôè</p>
  </SnoopPage>
</SnoopForm>
```
